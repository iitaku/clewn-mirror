INSTALL.txt - Clewn installation notes.
This document describes how to install Clewn.

    a) prerequisites
    b) compile
    c) install
    d) remote debugging


a) REQUIRED:
    GDB:	    gdb 6.4 or all previous versions starting from gdb 5.3
    VIM:	    any version starting from Vim 6.3 with
		    the |+netbeans_intg| feature enabled
    GNU readline

No need to check for the readline library: when running ./configure, a check
is made to ensure that readline can be found on the target system.
GNU readline can be found at:
    http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html


b) COMPILE:
In 'clewn' directory, run the following commands:

    ./configure
    make


c) INSTALL:
1 - Install the 'clewn' program somewhere in your $PATH.

2 - Install the runtime files:
    Copy the file clewn_runtime.tgz found in the runtime directory, to your
    runtime path. To find your runtime path location execute the vim command
    (this is usually $HOME/.vim):

	:set runtimepath?

    Untar clewn_runtime.tgz in your runtime path. After this step, you should
    have the following files:

	clewn.vim
	doc/clewn.txt
	macros/clewn_mappings.vim   (not needed with vim 7.0 and above)
	syntax/gdbvar.vim

    Change to the doc directory, start Vim and run the ":helptags ." command to
    process the taglist help file. Without this step, you cannot jump to the
    taglist help topics. You can now use the ":help clewn" command to get the
    clewn documentation.

d) REMOTE DEBUGGING:
When cross-compiling, add the --host and --build argument on the command
line of configure. Then run make. For example, with an arm target:

./configure CC=/path_to_gcc/arm-gcc --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu --host=arm-linux

The readline and curses libraries must be available on the target.

The following commands are run:

    host:	gvim -c "run clewn.vim" -nb:target_ip_address
    target:	clewn -x pathnames_map -nb:target_ip_address
